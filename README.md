## What's New in v1.2.4

- **Smart Lost & Sold Items Tracker (Buyback & Recycle Bin)**:
  - Real-time differential inventory change tracker that automatically logs every item sold to merchants, discarded, or deleted.
  - One-click restoration per item or bulk `>> Restore All Lost & Sold Items <<`.
  - Persistent disk storage (`Trinity_LostItems.txt`) so your buyback history persists across game sessions.
- **Quest & Special Item Catalog Archive**:
  - Dedicated searchable archive for 50+ Bounty Notices, Lore Documents, Recipes, Quest Keys, Relics, and Unique Gear.
- **Universal Backwards Compatibility (TU 1.10 – 1.18+)**: Multi-version adaptive memory layout and dynamic slot strides (`0xC0` for TU <= 1.15, `0xC8` for TU >= 1.16).
- **Runtime Binary Fingerprinting**: Live in-memory machine code scanner to accurately identify and display active Title Updates (e.g. `TU 1.18.02 (Active)`).
- **Cross-Slot Controller Free Flight**: Polling across controller slots 0 through 3 for robust multi-controller and PS5 pad support.
- **Dedicated Submenus**: Integrated **Money & Currency**, **Abyss Items & Artifacts**, and **Restore Items** submenus.
- **Engine Memory Safety Hardening**: Completely eliminated destructive memory writes and wrapped all subsystem refreshes in SEH for 100% crash-free stability.

## What's New in v1.2.3

- **Infinite Mount Stamina TU 1.18+ Fix**: Restored full infinite stamina support for horses, mounts, and dragons while galloping and sprinting.
- **Continuous Stamina & Spirit Auto-Refresh**: Refined stat commit interception so any consumed player or mount stamina and spirit instantly refreshes back to 100% full capacity in real-time.
- **Character Spontaneous Combustion Fix**: Completely purged thermal and elemental debuff meters (types 17, 18, 28, 48) from the scanner, permanently resolving the bug where characters caught fire upon spawn.
- **Native Weather & Environment Controls**: Built-in time of day and weather modifiers under the **WORLD** tab, providing seamless, crash-free environmental control without requiring conflicting external addons.
- **Protagonist Scanning Stability**: Hardened `TickResolveSelf` vital chain validation to eliminate access violation crashes in crowded NPC areas.

- **Add Item & Equipment System Hotfix**:

  - **Equipable Spawned Weapons & Armor**: Fixed spawned equipment showing as un-equipable by assigning unique 64-bit instance IDs and full durability (`10000`) on spawn across both server and client authority realms.
  - **Bucket Capacity Auto-Expansion**: Dynamically expands category capacity up to 2,000+ slots before injection and runs `RepairUsedSlots` to prevent `insert planner refused, err=-771604600 (no slot / bucket full)`.
  - **Non-Stackable Equipment Protection**: Smart `Max Stack Size` filter that preserves weapons, shields, and armors as single-instance items (`qty = 1`) so they can always be equipped without stack collisions, while materials and consumables stack up to 999,999.
